# natural-disasters
Reports on natural disaster data extracted from the EONET API from NASA


+ Sadly I seem, so far, unable to get this format/syntax to work in the
   requirements file and I've just spent an hour trying also within setup.py.

   I should probably get on with the core of this assignment.

The following does seem to work


`pip install git+git://github.com/keithlee-co-uk/natural-disaters`

`pip install -r natural-disaters/requirements.txt`



## Requirements

### Somethings I created earlier

These demostrate my use of packaging for pip.

#### defaultargs
##### For capturing the email address
+ A bit overkill because I'm not actually using the defaults this provides
  but I thought I'd show off the creation and use of decorators.

#### dbconnetion
Wrappers for database connections.

### Somethings I didn't create
+ requests
